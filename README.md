# GlassBumpRefraction Shader for ME
It's a shader mod for HS2 / AI-Shoujo Studio, letting an object be rendered as a refractive glass.

## How to Use
Download the **.zipmod** file for the latest version on the [Release](https://github.com/Blatke/GlassBumpRefraction-Shader-for-ME/releases) Page, then drag and drop it into your **/mods/** folder to finish installation, or use KKManager to install this mod.

In Studio, select the object you want to change the shader, and open MaterialEditor tab. Assign _Shader_ option to **Blake/GlassBumpRefraction**. In the following figure, I changed the shader of the plane item to this Shader.

If you don't need the shadow casted by the plane as a glass, can switch off the option of _Shader Casting Mode_ of its material on MaterialEditor tab.
